    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Diagnostics Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neural networks can fail silently** - They might produce confident-looking but wrong results\n",
    "2. **Not all posteriors are created equal** - Some might be overconfident, others too uncertain\n",
    "3. **Trust but verify** - Always check your inference before making decisions\n",
    "4. **Diagnostics catch different failures** - Each test reveals specific problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Diagnostic Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "| Diagnostic | What it checks | Red flag | What it catches |\n",
    "|------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Prior Predictive | Prior covers observations | Observations in extreme tails | Bad prior specification |\n",
    "| Training Diagnostics | Network convergence | Loss increasing or unstable | Insufficient training |\n",
    "| Posterior Predictive | Can recreate observations | Observations outside CI | Too little or uninformative data |\n",
    "| SBC | Calibrated credible intervals | Non-uniform rank histograms | Over/underconfident posteriors |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Always run diagnostics** - Make it part of your workflow  \n",
    "✅ **Start with the prior** - Bad prior → bad posterior  \n",
    "✅ **Document results** - Keep diagnostic reports with your analysis  \n",
    "✅ **Iterate if needed** - Poor diagnostics → adjust and retrain  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Challenge: Stress Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Try breaking the inference and seeing how diagnostics detect it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Too few simulations**: Retrain with only 500 simulations\n",
    "2. **Wrong prior**: Use a prior that doesn't contain true parameters\n",
    "3. **Corrupted data**: Add extreme outliers to observations\n",
    "\n",
